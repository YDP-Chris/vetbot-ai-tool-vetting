## 🎯 The Problem

Product managers know AI tools need validation, but most teams rely on ad-hoc testing that fails when real users get involved:

- ❌ **Minutes to break**: Users find edge cases your team missed in hours of testing
- ❌ **No clear metrics**: "Seems to work fine" isn't good enough for production decisions
- ❌ **Production failures**: Embarrassing AI breakdowns damage team credibility
- ❌ **Time pressure**: Shipping fast means skipping thorough validation

**Real story**: *A PM posted on Reddit asking for AI vetting frameworks. Top responses were "test it manually" and "hope for the best." That's not good enough.*

---

## ✨ The Solution

**Systematic validation that actually works:**

🎯 **Structured Testing Framework** - 13+ systematically designed test scenarios across 4 critical categories
📊 **Quantitative Scoring** - Clear 0-100 readiness scores with category breakdown
⚠️ **Failure Pattern Detection** - Automatically identifies common AI failure modes
📄 **Professional Reports** - Generate stakeholder-ready assessment reports

## 🎬 How It Works

| Step | Action | Time |
|------|--------|------|
| **1** | Select your AI tool type (Customer Support, Data Entry, etc.) | 30 sec |
| **2** | Define your specific use case | 1 min |
| **3** | Run systematic test scenarios | 10-25 min |
| **4** | Get quantitative scores & recommendations | Instant |
| **5** | Generate professional reports | 30 sec |

**Total time: 15-30 minutes** *(vs. weeks of ad-hoc testing)*

## 📊 Validation Categories

| Category | Weight | What It Tests |
|----------|--------|---------------|
| **Accuracy** | 40% | Core functionality, basic information handling, expected responses |
| **Edge Cases** | 30% | Ambiguous inputs, boundary conditions, unexpected scenarios |
| **User Experience** | 20% | Response clarity, multi-part requests, accessibility |
| **Security** | 10% | Data privacy, social engineering resistance, access control |
